## About the app Time2Share

This is a laravel app made for my HBO Computer Science

I am still developing my laravel skills so feedback is appreciated :D

## There are something you have to do before you can use this app:

1. Composer Install within the root folder
2. Editing the .env with the database you want to use (.env.example is an example which you can use)
3. Run the commands "php artisan migrate" and "php artisan db:seed"
4. After this you have to run the following command: "php artisan storage:link" -> Note
5. Now you can use "php artisan serve" and you are ready to go

* NOTE: Without this you wont be able to access the images from the "Add Product" form
